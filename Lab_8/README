Lab 8: Self Driving Car

Overview: In this lab you will be training a Deep Neural Network (DNN) using Keras to enable a car to drive autonomously.  Additionally, you will be generating your own training data and seeing the effect of using different data on the resulting model quality.  You will also be playing with some hyperparameters to get a sense of how they affect the overall model quality. 

This lab was created by adapting an exercise found here: https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-udacity-self-driving-car-simulator-4d78198d301d

Learning Outcomes:

Use the simulator to collect data of driving behavior
Use a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
Summarize the results with a written report
