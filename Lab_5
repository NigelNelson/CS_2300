Lab 5: Sparsity

Overview: In this lab you will be training a spam classifier using text messages.  To do this you will be modifying and extending a provided Jupyter Notebook that provides the fundamentals.  You will be using a bag-of-words model as a sparse matrix representation of the messages and experimenting with the effect of the sparsity on the storage and performance. 

The dataset comes from here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection

Learning Outcomes:

An understanding of the basics of training a model
Using a bag-of-words and TFIDF model in SKLearn
Adjusting sparsity to understand implications on model accuracy and performance
