Overview: In this lab you will be training a Deep Neural Network using DIGITS.  You will train and test various models and data sets to evaluate multiple aspects of training a DNN model. You will get some experience adjusting hyperparameters, augmenting data, trying different DNN architectures.  You will be writing a lab report to document your experience that includes screenshots.  

Learning Outcomes:

DNN model training
DNN model inference
Hyperparameter tuning
Data Augmentation Introduction
Overfitting
